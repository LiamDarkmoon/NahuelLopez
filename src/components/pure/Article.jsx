                    Here i&apos;ve started with a simple Landing page,
                    with good constrast between components imposed by colors,
                    while the navbar and all the backgrounds are in this sandy color that make them soft and welcoming,
                    the CTAs are bright red inviting you to interacts with them,
                    i&apos;ve played a lot too with opacities helping this way the body&apos;s background no&apos;t to be so opresive
                    and get some deep.
                </p>
            </div>
        </article>
